Campaign playstyle: The player will control 4-12 units at most times (for quick turns) – The player will control core of loyal units and a bunch of militia units; the militia will automatically be replaced over time and can be considered cannon fodder – There should not be more than 30 active/moving units on the entire map (for quick turns) – Any dialogue/story text should be short (no more than 1min spent on reading within a turn) – Experience is removed completely, the level of militia depends on the town and the level of the loyal units can tie to story elements – RPG elements will exist in terms of items being found and some new abilities being learnt for the loyal units over time. Gold can also be spent on rpg related things. -- Total play-time per scenario: 20-60min. 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Broad Lore: Wesnoth world – Time unknown – all factions and units that we like – all biomes that we can think of – Overarching threat is magic running rampant and mages from the homeland – The magic is spreading to the new land after a while. – The power-crazy mages are all vying for control and warring with each other. 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario 1 extra: The time of day is not tied to turns, manual time shifts only. As the units move they can comment on resources they see -- Map gets labeled as we explore it -- Orc encampment to the north east (harasses settlement over several scenarios but are hindered by the river between them) -- Mountains to the north west will contain some locked of goodies -- cave systems that triggers when you step on a cave entrance -- all units fully healed after each rest/longer time skip 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario 1 Plot: Arrive on beach mid day on a small rowboat (the ship could not reach land) -> the ship sails away to pick up the refugees/settlers -> scouts decides to follow the coastline south ->  spots a goblin scout in the forest (hint at later attack), gets attacked by something on the way, move to mountain to get a good vantage point -> From the mountain they see a good camp location -> move there -> makes a fire, cut to night-time, ambushed by wolfs, a few wolfs at first then the last wolf summons more wolfs + alpha -> kills wolfs, cut to next day -> moves north to scout -> arrives at the lake, encounter hunter hero and 2 hunter militia fighting a bear -> move east to greet the settlers that should arrive soon -> camp for the night near hunter’s home (fade to black and back again, next day) -> moves towards coast -> something happens on the way -> they reach the coast and set up a camp -> collect some resources, hunt, chop some wood, build a tiny pier for the ship (fade to black 4 weeks later, a small encampment built) -> The ship is sighted -> The rest of the settlers arrive, greetings, starts unloading ship, comment on mystical wooden crate -> something happens ->  (fade to black and back again, teleport all units to settlement, 2 weeks later, a medium size encampment built) some random assignment cause our military units to move away from the village, leaving settlers and Arnelda behind, the village then gets attacked by goblins from the north east, crossing the river right next to the village. -> Arnelda have to fend them off while military units moves back to help -> Arnelda dies right before help arrives -> fend off the attack with your units -> Some more hunters/settlers from the northwest arrives, they join the fight. (At this point you control about 12 military units, the settlers are AI) -> some outro with the burial of Arnelda -> end of scenario. (Estimated playtime at 35min)

Kvesten -- Backstory village: Large village of 120 people, lost population over last years, 80 pop now. Taxes are extreme, food is scarce, magical corruption/abomination/elementals is killing people. Rival mages and bandits kill even more.
Backstory northern village: tiny igloo/Inuit village -- 20 people at the point of emigrating – emigrated due to lack of food and nearby threats (drakes and orcs)
