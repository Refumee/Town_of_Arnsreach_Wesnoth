Campaign playstyle: The player will control 4-12 units at most times (for quick turns) – The player will control core of loyal units and a bunch of militia units; the militia will automatically be replaced over time and can be considered cannon fodder – There should not be more than 30 active/moving units on the entire map (for quick turns) – Any dialogue/story text should be short (no more than 1min spent on reading within a turn) – Experience is removed completely, the level of militia depends on the town and the level of the loyal units can tie to story elements – RPG elements will exists in terms of items being found and some new abilities being learnt for the loyal units over time. -- Total play-time per scenario: 20-60min.
